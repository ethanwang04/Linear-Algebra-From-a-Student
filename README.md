# Linear-Algebra-From-a-Student
Linear algebra course created from a student's prespective

Hi! My name is Ethan, and I am entering my third year of undergraduate study. I learned linear algebra in my first year of study,
and will be assisting as part of the teaching staff for a theorhetical linear algebra course. This is a collection of notes made
with the purpose of assisting in the learning of linear algebra. I hope this helps!
